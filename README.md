# Hello there! <img src="https://github.com/ShammiL/ShammiL/blob/main/images/wave_1.gif" width="25px">
<!-- ðŸ‘‹ -->

I am an undergraduate at the Computer Science and Engineering department of the University of Moratuwa. I have worked on web-based projects and machine learning projects. I completed my internship at IFS R&D International (Pvt) Ltd. and am currently working on my final year project which is to develop a deep learning-based chest x-ray analysis framework. You can find me on [![LinkedIn][1.3]][1] and [![Medium][1.4]][2]
